# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    the_site: "In 2013, I was a trakehner horse breeder from Washington state in
  the Pacific NorthWestern United States.  I am Susan Prestage, formerly of
  Tabarah Ranch Trakehners.  I intend this site to be a useful tool
  for the Trakehner community for researching Trakehner bloodlines.  My hope
  is that this can be be a helpful contribution to the community.  I in no
  way wish to trod on any toes or be disrespectful in any way.  If my
  site or content troubles you or perhaps you would like to contribute
  additional data or recommendations, I eagerly solicit your views and
  contributions."
    the_motivation: "I was inspired to create this site shortly after an ATA inspection
  I attended in Washington state in 2011.  I was looking to improve a slight
  weakness in the croup in my mare line and found that I had a hard
  time researching the stallions and bloodlines to my satisfaction.  Being
  a web developer in addition to a Trakehner horse breeder, this website was a
  natural result of this struggle.  I hope using this site gives you as much
  pleasure as it does me.  Thank you for visiting."
    the_invitation: "I invite you to visit me at my professional portfolio website as
    well as the memorial to my old home Trakehner website."
